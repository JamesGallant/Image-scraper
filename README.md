# ScraperBot
This is a image scraper written to function with google chrome and google images. The idea behind this scraper is to get sufficient images for deep learning and is a building block for other projects I have in mind. Some annoyances that this script may have, it uses command line arguments and searches one keyword at a time. It will download images if the site allowes it so not all images from the google images view will be gathered. Especially important for deep learning purposes is that the bot will download whatever it sees, so please curate the images. Your AI might learn some random things! This is not the fastest scraper out there, I wrote it to gather URLs from images first and then download the files if possible. This is to not over burden any websites with scraper traffic. Anyways follow the insturctions below to get scraping.

# Requirements
- [Google chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/)
- [chrome web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This bot only funcitons with chrome at the moment and thus you will need the google chrome browser. The next thing you need to know is your chrome version, this can be found by accessing the settings menu and navigating to the help menu then the about chrome menu. This will tell you which major version (the number before the first full stop) of chrome you have. Navigate to the chrome web driver downloads page and download the correct version. Finally download python three if you dont have it.
